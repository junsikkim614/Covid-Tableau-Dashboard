# Covid-Tableau-Dashboard

Continuation of the Covid-19 Project. 

I created several other queries using SQL to use for tables and graphs in this project. Using these queries I was able to create a basic COVID 19 dashboard using the data to showcase total cases, infection rate by countries, trends in several countries as well as total death counts in several continents.
